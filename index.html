        <p class="pro blurb">I studied mechanical engineering in college and really liked it. Afterward, I worked at a
          robotics startup for a couple of years. Now I am branching out and trying a couple other things, including web
          design of this page! I hope for this section to become a portfolio of programming projects. For now, it has
          mostly trivial early tasks I am performing as part of the online class I am taking. Stary tuned for more as I
          get better. </p>
        <p class="pro blurb"> Here is my <a href="./public/resume.html">resume</a>, mostly including things from when I
          worked as a
          robotics engineer.

        <p class="adv blurb">I love adventure in
          endless forms. I love adventure that's not the norm, I love adventure in a storm. I love it here
          and I love it there, I love adventures everywhere. For as long as I
          can remember I've loved to see whats around the trail's bend and it has lead me to the most joyful and
          memorable
          experiences in my limited time here on Earth. My dad also read green eggs and ham to me as a kid. </p>

          <p class="item-blurb">My formative adventure. The best summer of my life as I spent 4 months walking a dusty
            path through Calfornia, Oregon and Washington. Through smoke and heat, frost and pain, I realized that not
            only can you be
            supremely happy in spite of being dirty, tired, and hungry, you might find yourself happy because of those
            things.

          <p class="item-blurb">My long-planned, very first high route from Rocky Mountain National Park to I-70. An
            amazing
            5-day solo adventure full of
            wildflowers, navigation skill building and thunder- and hail-based humblings. Probably the greatest
            bang-for-my-buck
            adventure I have ever done.

        <p class="writ blurb">I've always enjoyed thinking about ideas, and for the last couple of years I have also
          liked wriitng them down. Even more recently I have been fleshing out some of my thoughts and stories and
          sharing them. This is a new endeavor for me, but its been a lot of fun so far and I hope to make it a
          consistent practice.</p>

        <p class="hand blurb">I like to make stuff with my hands from time to time. I always wish I had more time to
          spend on this stuff, but the few projects I have managed to complete have been great joys to me. So far I
          have mostly done woodworking and textiles, but I really want to get into welding fabrication,
          mechanical and electronics tinkering, too. Basically I want to try it all.</p>
