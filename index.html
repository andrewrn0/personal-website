        website
        purely from
        vanilla html and css as practice. My favorite color is orange.

          adventure in many forms. I love adventure outside the norm, I love adventure in a storm. I love it
          here and I love it there, I love adventures everywhere. My dad also read green eggs and ham to me as a kid.

          <p class="item-blurb">My formative adventure. The best summer of my life as I spent 4 months walking a dusty
            path through Calfornia, Oregon and Washington. Through smoke and heat, frost and pain, I realized that not
            only can you be
            supremely happy in spite of being dirty, tired, and hungry, you might find yourself happy because of those
            things. The image on the left was taken by my talented friend <a href="https://www.nurner.com/">Nathan
              Hurner</a>.

          <p class="item-blurb"> There is an image album at the link below. I used bootstrap to make that, for practice
            of course.</p>

          <p class="item-blurb">My long-planned, very first high route from Rocky Mountain National Park to I-70. An
            amazing
            5-day solo adventure full of
            wildflowers, navigation skill building and thunder- and hail-based humblings. Probably the greatest
            bang-for-my-buck
            adventure I have ever done.

        <p class="hand blurb">I have enjoyed making stuff in the few times I have had access to equpment and time. So
          far this has consisted of woodworking and
          textiles, but I want to eventually try a lot more stuff, like blacksmithing, building-scale carpentry, and
          electronics stuff. I wish I had more time and equipment space for this. </p>

          <p class="item-blurb">My first major woodworking project was this little oak nightstand made in winter 2022.
            It is an
            uncharacteristically nice first project because of the terrifically well-equipped <a
              href="https://tinkermill.org/">makerspace in Longmont, CO</a>. The front is patterned plywood, I learned
            that in this Youtube <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XjxfVR2K_Ew">video</a>.

          <p class="item-blurb">In winter 2023 I made my first textile project: these stem bags for bikepacking. I
            learned from the pattern on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XjxfVR2K_Ew">MYOG</a>, which has a
            bunch of other cool stuff too.

          <p class="item-blurb">I made this pair of miniature PCT monuments to commemorate my 2021 hike. Even though
            simple, these are still one of my favorite projects. I used a table saw, mitre saw, and a lazer engraver.

            some dollar fabric at Joanns. It looks better in person, I swear.

          these ideas and
          sharing them online. This is also something I want to massively expand, its suprisingly very fun.</p>
